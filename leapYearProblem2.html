<h1>Is It a Leap Year?</h1>
<p id ="yesNo"></p>

<!-- Leap year Rules:
1. must be divisible by 4
2. Cannot be divisble by 100
3. can be divisible by 400 

Or another way to say... A year will be a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. If a year is divisible by 4 and by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/725098/leap-year-calculation-->

<!-- create a function that prompts user to input a year then crunch it and give back answer either "This is a leap year" or This is not a leap yar -->
<!-- There are 30 leap years between 1900 and 2020:
1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020. -->
