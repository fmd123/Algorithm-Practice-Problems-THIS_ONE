	how many strings are in the arr array? 
	<div id="answer"></div>


	<script>

	var count = 0; //this is the number of strings found as go through arr.
	 //number of items in arr

	//count should be six after we use the for loop to count how many strings are in the array
	//hint: typeof(------)

	var arr = ["hello", "There", 3, ["one", 2], 5, "another", "string", "solve", 6 , "me"];
	var arrayLength = arr.length;// this needs to be below var arr statement or it gets upset by arr being undefined.


	//i is the loop counter (i.e. based on index)
		for( i = 0; i< arr.length; i++) {
			if (typeof arr[i] == "string") {
				count = count +1;
			} else if (typeof arr[i] != "string") {
			}



		}

//I need to have a way to decide if item is a string or not. Use typeof! 



	document.getElementById('answer').innerHTML = count;
