<!-- 4. Write a function which takes an array of integers and returns an array with any duplicate integers removed.
[1,1,2,3,1,2,3] -> [1,2,3]
[1,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4] -> [1,4,2] -->


<h2>Problem 4: Removing Duplicate Integers from An Array</h2>
<p></p>
<p id = "unduplicated"></p>

<script>

	function unDuplicate(arr) {
		// arr = [1,1,2,3,1,2,3];
		arr = [1,1,2,3,1,2,3];
		var unduped = [];

			for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
				if (unduped.indexOf(arr[i]) == -1){
					unduped.push(arr[i]);
				}
			}

		document.getElementById("unduplicated").innerHTML = unduped;
	}
	unDuplicate();
</script>
<!-- How it works: unduped.indexOf(arr[i]) == -1) arr[i] is the element at i. 
E.g. 1 is value of arr at index 0. So 1 is argument for unduped.indexOf. 
IndexOf takes an element and returns its index. Since there is no 1 in unduped array the index will be undefined.
setting it to ===-1 will capture that undefined  state  and if this is the case then 1 (first value of arr[i])
will be pushed into array. Next time we see a one there will be an index for a 1 already so it will 
not push an additional one into the unduped array.
