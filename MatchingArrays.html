	<title>Matching Arrays</title>
	<!-- 6. Write a function which takes in two arrays and determines if they contain the same number of the same values.

[], [] -> true
[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3] -> false
["a", "c", "b"], ["a", "b", "c"] -> true
[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1] -> false
 -->
<!-- compare array .lengths -if not equal then return false -->
<!-- Use for loop or use the i in whatever thing...
	Compare each element at same index. As soon as a comparison is not equal then return false
	if all elements are same then return true. USE THIS FOR LOTTO ASSIGNMENT :-)
	can add a prompt to get the info but I should do input box stuff.-->

	//if I were to do this again I would have put the test for equal array length at beginning of equallyEmpty but it was already built into compare by time I realized that I needed to test for condition of two equally empty arrays. 
	//I can rework this later but for now I need to move on! :-)
